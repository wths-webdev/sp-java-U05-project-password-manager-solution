# Password Manager Project
## Instructions

Write a class called PasswordManager. The PasswordManager class must keep the username and password as instance variables. There needs to be a default constructor that sets that username and password to null and a parameter constructor that sets the username and password based on passed parameters.

There then needs to be accessor methods (get) and mutator methods (set) for both the username and password.

Create a toString method that returns â€œYour username is __________ and your password is __________.

Add one method of your creation to the class. Feel free to add an instance variable. (E.g. password strength checker, add a security question, password generator, password expiration date)

In the Main class write a main method that will test all possible cases and ensure they work.  

### Sample run
```
Your username is null and your password is null
Your username is Ash Ketchum and your password is null
Your username is Ash Ketchum and your password is bulbasaur1
```
